Temperature sensor works well with Mini-IOT-S1.

## Overview

Temperature sensors have a wide range of applications and we all use temperature sensors in our daily lives.
A temperature sensor is a device, typically, a thermocouple or resistance temperature detector, that provides temperature measurement in a readable form through an electrical signal. 

There are four main temperature sensors used today in modern-day electronics: Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors, resistance temperature detectors (RTDs), thermocouples, and semiconductor-based integrated (IC) sensors.
And a temperature sensor with an analog output, uses the transfer function to determine the temperature. A sensor with a digital output, does not require the system to know or program the internal analog transfer function to determine the temperature.

Mini-IOT-S1 Compatible with all kinds of Temperature Sensor. It can be wired or wireless as your required.

It's Fully customizable with Mini-IOT-S1. Suitable for your own server or any other cloud such as Azure, AWS. All data only can access by you.
